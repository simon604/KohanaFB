        						<strong>Dear cricket fan,</strong><br/><br/>
Here's a great competition for all the players in your club to test their cricket skills while following the Commonwealth Bank Series this February to March. 
<br/><br/>
Maybe your players know history and statistics better than anyone else. Maybe they have a good knowledge of science, speed, power and trajectory. Or maybe, like us, you all just really love cricket. 
<br/><br/><strong>
Whatever people's strengths are, it's time for them to put their skills on show. Share this with all the members of your club and everyone you know who loves cricket!
				</strong>

									<br/><br/>
Simply place the marker where you think the first boundary shot of a match will cross the rope. If yours is one of the closest when that first big 4 or 6 is hit, you'll go in the draw to win. It really is that easy!
<br/><br/>
Players can also challenge friends and see how they compare, as well as see how they rank in Australia. So what are you waiting for? Share this now and see who really knows their cricket! The first game opens on Saturday February 4th on the Commonwealth Bank Facebook page.
<br/><br/><strong>
PLOT THE SHOT. It's anyone's game.</strong><br/><br/>
